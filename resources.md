Useful Books
---
* [Programming in Scala: A Comprehensive Step-by-Step Guide, 2nd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Comprehensive-Step---Step/dp/0981531644/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1417458396&sr=8-2&keywords=scala+programming).  Co-authored by Martin Odersky, Scala's author, this is perhaps the single best Scala book to have if you're only buying one.
* [Scala Cookbook: Recipes for Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Scala-Cookbook-Object-Oriented-Functional-Programming/dp/1449339611/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid=1417458396&sr=8-13&keywords=scala+programming).  Like most cookbooks, this one is fun in that it allows you to skim through selected topics at liesure.  This is where I learned to love giter8.
* [Functional Programming in Scala](http://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Scala-Paul-Chiusano/dp/1617290653/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1417458396&sr=8-1&keywords=scala+programming).  This is a good but non-trivial tutorial on Scala and functional programming. Not an easy read, I expect to be working through this for several weeks.
